## Goals

* Optimizing HTML and CSS syntax 
* Adding accessibility to allow readability to visitors
* Repairing Links

## Ticket Summary

* The website's original structure was cramped and cluttered. With spacing out the semantic tags, viewing the HTML is easier seperate and more defined for further development. Div tag elements were replaced with semantics to allow for flow layout and CSS was grouped together to follow the HTML structure. Comments have been placed throughout each code file to give more clarity on syntax structure. One link was fixed and is now active. Functionality was retained while adding alt image descriptions for accessibility. Font has been changed to allow reading more visibility of text content.
